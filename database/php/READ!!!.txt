the API php output the methods configuration to call them, here there is no 
configuration file, just set up php/api.php file

first you need to set the server classes at row 56 in the php/api.php file, 
it create the method configuration calling the ExtDirect/API.php and ExtDirect/CacheProvider.php

the method configuration set the url of the router php/router.php

the router accepts requests from the client side route them the the class, method passing
the arguments
requests can be via json-encoded raw http post or form post
the router send back a response json encoded or the error response (should be turn off!!!)



the app.js file call Ext.direct.Manager.addProvider(Ext.app.REMOTING_API) so that your
actions will exist in the global namespace
by including a namespace in the method configuration actions can be namespaced (e.g. Ext.ss)
