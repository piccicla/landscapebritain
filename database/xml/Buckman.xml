He theorizes that the vertical materials were the droppings from melting ice floating down a large river. This river, formed out of one or more of the original eonsequents of the Thames system, existed before the valley of the Warwickshire Avon had been excavated. By one branch, possibly the upper Trent, it drained the Pennine range; by another, possibly the upper Severn, the Welsh hills. Ice formed in the upper waters-in these highlands-enclosing debris, and when a thaw occurred, it floated down to the lower parts of the river. The Author notices certain flints obtained from the gravels. Those from the upper bed are sharply angular, even most finely pointed, and are quite unabraded. They strengthen the theory of ice-transport, and it is evident that they have not been moved by stream-action since their deposition, otherwise they would show signs of wear. The flints from the lower bed do seem to point to some such condition of subsequent removal: they have their edges worn, and are in some cases battered, and peculiarly flaked as if artificially worked. The Author surmises that the date of the gravel, if formed by a river-system as supposed, is Pliocene.</style></abstract><notes><style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">Export Date: 7 November 2011&#xD;Source: Scopus</style></notes><urls><related-urls><url><style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-80052325919&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=35794c1ab9fed3cc8d21d0b1df89c907</style></url><url><style face="normal" font="default" size="100%">http://jgslegacy.lyellcollection.org/content/55/1-4/220.1.full.pdf</style></url></related-urls></urls></record></records></xml>
